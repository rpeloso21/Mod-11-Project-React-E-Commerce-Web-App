# E-Commerce Web App with React

## About:
This is an E-commerce Web App that handles requests for CRUD functions related to customers, products, and orders.
The routes outlined in this program allow for manipulation of each type of data shown above by creating endpoints for their most necessary functions.
This is a front end app that is tied to a back end provided in our Mod 6 project.

## How to set up:
- Open a terminal

- Visit github.com/rpeloso21/Mod-11-Project-React-E-Commerce-Web-App

- Clone the repository

- cd into the project directory 'Mod 11 Project Project E-Commerce Web App' and then into /my-react-project.

- Make sure to install the necessary dependencies with npm install:  ('axios', 'react-router-dom', 'react-bootstrap', and 'bootstrap'.

##  Launching the App
- The back-end will need to be started first.  This is the Mod 6 Project.  You can open the file and run the 'flask run' command.  This will open our end-points.
- After this, you will need to start up the react app by running the 'npm run dev' command in the project directory.
